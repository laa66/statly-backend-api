# Statly - Your personal Spotify statsüéµ

Statly is a web application powered by Spotify API that lets you view your music
statistics, analyze your audio library, playlists, check recently played tracks, follow friends, match music libraries and create playlist battles.
You can also export a playlist to your Spotify account from your favourite tracks in three different
ranges.

Check out [Statly](https://laa66.github.io/statly-frontend/) to see the application in action.

**Important Note!**

    To access the app, please click on "Join Beta" and register with your full name and 
    Spotify email address associated with your Spotify account.

    This is necessary because I use the basic version of the Spotify API and I
    need to add testers to Spotify developer panel to grant them access.
