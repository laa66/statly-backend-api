# Statly - Your personal Spotify stats üéµ

Statly is a web application powered by Spotify API that lets you view your music
statistics, account mainstream score, and recently played tracks.
You can also export a playlist to your Spotify account from your favourite tracks in three different
ranges.

Check out the [Statly demo](https://statly-app.onrender.com) to see the application in action.

**Important Note!**

    To access the app, please click on "Join Beta" and register with your full name and 
    Spotify email address associated with your Spotify account.

    This is necessary because I use the basic version of the Spotify API and 
    need to add testers to Spotify developer panel to grant them access.

2. Set the ``SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID``, ``SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`` environment variables
   with the values from your Spotify Developer panel and set ``STATLY_APP_URL``
