# Statly - Your personal Spotify statsüéµ

Statly is a web application powered by Spotify API that lets you view your music
statistics, account mainstream score, and recently played tracks.
You can also export a playlist to your Spotify account from your favourite tracks in three different
ranges.

Check out [Statly](https://laa66.github.io/statly-frontend/) to see the application in action.

<hr>

**Important Note!**

    To access the app, please click on "Join Beta" and register with your full name and 
    Spotify email address associated with your Spotify account.

    This is necessary because I use the basic version of the Spotify API and I
    need to add testers to Spotify developer panel to grant them access.

## How to run ‚ö°
